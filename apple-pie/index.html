      This was my grandmother's apple pie recipe. I have never seen another one quite like it. It will always
      be my favorite and has won me several first place prizes in local competitions. I hope it becomes one of your
      favorites as well!

      <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
          Melt the butter in a saucepan. Stir in flour to form a paste. Add water, white sugar and brown sugar, and
          bring
          to a boil.
        </li>
        <li>Reduce temperature and let simmer. Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded
          slightly. Cover with a lattice work crust. Gently pour the sugar and butter liquid over the crust. Pour slowly
          so
          that it does not run off. </li>
        <li>
          Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F (175
          degrees C). Continue baking for 35 to 45 minutes, until apples are soft.
